## Purpose
If you're a vocal student or hobbyist, you don't always have the time to be able to travel to take lessons in person, and the local vocal coaches might not be ideal for what kind of instruction you are looking for.
With Singly, we have solved both of those issues. We have created a platform for the users to find their ideal teacher match and have remote lessons in the comfort of the space of their choosing!
